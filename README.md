# undistracted

uBlock Origin filters, for a less distracted browsing experience.

This set of filters aims to block any distractions from websites, like related content, static advertising, and AI "features." It tries to be pretty aggressive in scope.

The supported sites can be [found here](undistracted-sites.md).

The uBlock filter list can be found under [undistracted.txt](undistracted.txt).

## adding websites

If you want to fix a website or add a recommendation, go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/ettedh/undistracted/issues). Note that plaintext filters (like `##.recommended`) are preferred to obfuscated tags (like `##.content.Ekn9J\:center-text.llm-glow`).
